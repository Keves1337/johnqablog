            I'm a 33-year-old creative professional based in{" "}
            <span className="text-foreground font-medium">Ashdod, Israel</span>.
            I'm currently working as a baker at Roladin, but my journey has been
            anything but conventional.
          </p>

          <p>
            My passion for music led me to become a DJ and dive deep into
            electronic music production. I've spent countless hours mastering
            tools like <span className="text-foreground font-medium">Cubase</span>,{" "}
            <span className="text-foreground font-medium">FL Studio</span>, and{" "}
            <span className="text-foreground font-medium">Ableton</span> â€”
            crafting beats and mixing tracks that move people.
          </p>

          <p>
            Along the way, I discovered another love:{" "}
            <span className="text-foreground font-medium">UI/UX design</span>.
            The intersection of aesthetics and functionality fascinated me, and I
            delved into learning design principles and tools.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now, I'm channeling all these experiences into my passion for gaming,
            where I've developed <span className="text-foreground font-medium">strategic thinking</span>,{" "}
            <span className="text-foreground font-medium">quick decision-making</span>, and exceptional{" "}
            <span className="text-foreground font-medium">team coordination skills</span>.
